User input in order to continue the adventure.
The adventure route ends when you get to locationList[9]; the inn, 
	regardless of which route you take they all end here.
You have to restart the program to continue the other routes.

Bugs:
- couldn't get gameover functions to work properly and stop the user 
	when it happened. Specifically for question one case "a". 
	I added a bunch of empty lines so it would feel over...
		-(meaning you hold enter until it closes of just exit manually)
		- left the gameover attempts there as //notes.
- Q1 "default" option..
	- I didn't know how to make it restart at the beginning of this question
	in order to restart and continue.
